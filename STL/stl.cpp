// stl stands for standard template library. It is a library of container classes, algorithms, and iterators. It is a generalized library and so, its components are parameterized. A working knowledge of template classes is a prerequisite for working with STL. STL has four components. They are: Algorithms, Containers, Functions, and Iterators. STL has several advantages over traditional C++ libraries. It increases the efficiency and performance of the code. It is highly reliable and has a high degree of reusability. It is highly portable. It is highly flexible and extensible. It is highly secure. It is highly optimized. It is highly scalable. It is highly maintainable
